# Project Vader [codename]
A single-page, calendar application used to coordinate open availability times. The calendar is linkable. Sort of like a poll, once complete, all of the data will be tallied and a new calendar will be shown. The new calendar shows all of the dates that ALL participants are available at the same times.
